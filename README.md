# (Exression) Calculator

[//]: # (_The Last Markdown Editor, Ever_)

Calculator compute seemingly simple expressions like: 8+20.5*2. Expected value is 49.
For humans is obvious, but think how we can program this idea to be ''understandable''
by computers. Contrary to appearances this is not a trivial task. To handle this problem
we use idea of **tokens** and **grammars**.

## Features

- Follows the order of the arithmetic operations
    - 8 + 20.5 * 2 = 8 + (20.5 * 2) = 8 + 41 = 49
- Handles negative numbers
- Handles modulo operator
- Variables
    - let var = 7.2;

## Usage
Run program and type correct mathematical expression using above features. Wait for result.
